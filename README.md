# Menu Choice Program (C Language)

## üìå How It Works
This program displays a simple menu with three drink options: Tea, Coffee, and Juice.  
It asks the user to enter a number (1, 2, or 3) to select a drink.  
The program then uses a `switch` statement to check which option the user chose:  
- If the number matches a drink, it shows the drink‚Äôs name and price.  
- If the number does not match any option, it shows **"Invalid Choice"**.  
The `break` statement ensures the program stops checking once a match is found.
